\subsection{Introduction}
While the current project focuses on drill string models, it is natural to couple a string model with a bit model. The Richard-Germay-Detournay family of bit models (RGD models) represents theoretical bit-rock interactions. They use a more sophisticated approach than many bit models and are, therefore, of interest. The RGD model is developed by Richard et al., 2007\ \cite{ref:richard2007a}, which simulates coupled axial and torsional vibration mode through bit-rock interaction. The model is widely applied to numerous drill-string models by providing sophisticated bit-rock interactions.
\subsection{RGD Model}
The model combines governing equations of motions (axial and torsional) with bit-rock interface law which leads to state-dependent delay system. Also, the model takes into account the loss of contact at wearflat/rock interface caused by axial vibration of the bit through discontinuous boundary conditions. Brief description of mathematical background is shown in \figurename~\ref{figure_RGD_Summary}. The torsional and axial mode are coupled by bit-rock interaction model by the depth of cut. Moreover, functions $T_c$, $T_f$, $W_C$ and $W_f$ are defined with respect to drilling regime which reflects the discontinuous boundary conditions. The drilling regimes are classified as 1.\ cutting ($\omega>0, d>0$), 2.\ sticking ($\omega=0, d>0$) 3.\ sliding ($\omega>0, d=0$), 4.\ and off-bottom ($\omega>0, d<0$). 

The system is characterized by 2 DOF system with neglected damping by assuming most of the energy dissipation in drilling systems occurs at the bit-rock interface. The base assumptions of the model are 1.\ constant angular velocity and upward force at the top of the drill string, 2.\ vertical borehole and 3.\ no lateral motions of the bit. The self-excited vibration was demonstrated and the model was also validated with laboratory tests. However, since the model is a bit model, not a drill string model, and is limited to vertical well, it was not selected for this project. Moreover, because of the limited degrees of freedom, the model was not able to capture stick-slip occurrence at a frequency higher than the first torsional mode.

\subsection{Extended RGD Model}
Although it was not applied in this project, numerous drill string models benchmarked RGD model for bit-rock interactions. \figurename~\ref{model_develop_figure} illustrates the development of the RGD model. Germay increased DOF of the model by discretizing the drill string and applying the finite element method \referencename~\cite{ref:germay2009a}. This model was able to simulate the stick phase that occurred by vibration higher than the first natural torsional frequency. Similarly, Zhang increased the DOF of the model by implementing the spectral method and further improved the computational efficiency by applying Chebyshev polynomial as a basis function \referencename~\cite{ref:zhang2020a}. The model was able to simulate axial and torsional vibrations, including stick-slip events, with enhanced computation efficiency compared to the FEM approach in a geometrically simple structure. The source code was not provided, therefore; we could not test for this project. However, these models can be good candidates for further study. The source code of the 2DOF RGD bit model, applying the spectral method is provided, and mathematical details based on the code can be seen in \appendixname~\ref{ap:rgbworkflow}.
