The project \emph{Research on Numerical Simulation of Downhole Drill String Dynamics} reviewed a set of open-source and published models to assess their features.  Of primary interest were models rated to drill string dynamics.  Two models were selected for evaluation.  While not evaluated, a thorough review of a family of bit models was conducted as it will be of interest in the future.

A series of test cases was devised to compare the models.  A set of procedures and methods for evaluating drill string models was established and documented.  Each model was then run on the test cases.

The first model selected was the model from Aarsnes and Shor.  Two versions of the model are available, a more mature version in Matlab and an upgraded version written in Python.  While the Python version is being written to improve the older version, development is still in progress.

The second model selected was developed at ExxonMobil and is written in Python.
