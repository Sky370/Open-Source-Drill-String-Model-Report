\chapter{Introduction}
This document was created as part of the project \emph{Research on Numerical Simulation of Downhole Drill String Dynamics}, a fundamentals research project at CNPC USA.  The project was proposed and kicked off in 2023.

The concept for a model review and evaluation result from conversations with members of the \osdc{} (\referencename~\cite{ref:pastusek2019a}).  A number of models have been released to the community's \emph{Github} site, however, it was not known exactly how the models compare in terms of features and performance.

\section{Objectives}
The primary motivation for CNPC USA was to evaluate soft string models.  However, in order to compare models, it is necessary to have a set test cases as well as a means to establish a fair comparison.  Based on these requirements, the following were adopted as objectives.
\begin{numberedlist}
	\item Establish a set test cases for comparing drill string models.
	\item Document procedures and methods used in the comparisons.
	\item Compare soft string models and assess features and performance.
\end{numberedlist}

\section{Model Review}
The models associated with drilling dynamics and that were available on the \osdc{} Github site were reviewed.  However, not all of these models were exercised.  Some of the models did not pertain directly to drill strings or lacked key features.  For a summary of all the models reviewed, please see \chaptername~\ref{ch:modelreview}.
