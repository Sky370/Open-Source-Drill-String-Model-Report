\chapter{Introduction}
This document was created as part of the project \emph{Research on Numerical Simulation of Downhole Drill String Dynamics}, a fundamentals research project proposed and kicked off in 2023.

The concept for a model review and evaluation result from conversations with members of the \osdc{} (\referencename~\cite{ref:pastusek2019a}).  A number of models have been released to the community's \emph{Github} site, however, it was not known exactly how the models compare in terms of features and performance.
